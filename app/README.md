# Popular Movies

This is a new Android app that displays movies by Highest Rated and Most Popular. I created it for the Android Developer Nanodegree program.
This app shows different activities screens, sort order, API library usage, and also has an About App section.

*Popular Movies* was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as "Exceeds Specifications".

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover new movies from The Movie Database library
* Sort movies by Most Popular and Highest Rated
* Read movie descriptions, along with Release Date, rating, and a poster view.

## How to Work with the API

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to NetworkUtils in the field "String apiKey"
